#### Recursion

In computer science, recursion is a problem solving technique, and closely related to mathematical induction, where we define the solution as a combination of solutions to smaller instances of the same problem.  

#### Recursive Algorithms

​	**Step 1: The Base Case:** Solve the problem for the smallest possible input

​	**Step 2: The Recursive Step:** Define the induction hypothesis. Assume that when calling the function on a smaller input, it does its job. Based on this
​                 assumption, we find how to combine calls to smaller instances in order to solve the problem for the given input.
