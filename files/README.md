#### C++ Files

To work with files in C++, we need to include `fstream` library. 

There are 3 classes in the `fstream` library, which are used to create, write and read files:

- `ofstream` : creates and writes to files
- `ifstream` : reads from files
- `fstream` : combination of `ofstream` and `ifstream`

5 steps to create, write and read files:

1. Declare a file-stream variable.
2. Open a file to write to.
3. Write information to the file.
4. Read information from the file.
5. Close the file stream.
